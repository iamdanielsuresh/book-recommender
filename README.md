## üåü Overview

This project transforms raw book metadata into a semantic recommender system. Starting with 7,000+ books from Kaggle, I explored the data, built a vector search engine, generalized categories with zero-shot classification, added sentiment analysis, and wrapped it in a slick Gradio dashboard. It‚Äôs fast, free, and runs locally (or soon on DigitalOcean!).

### Key Features
- **Semantic Search**: Find books by description using SBERT embeddings.
- **Category Filters**: Generalized categories (e.g., Fiction, Children‚Äôs) via zero-shot LLM.
- **Emotional Tones**: Sort by feelings (Happy, Sad, etc.) with sentiment analysis.
- **Interactive UI**: Gradio dashboard with thumbnails and clickable source code.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

Here‚Äôs the journey from raw data to dope dashboard:

### 1. Data Exploration (`data-exploration.ipynb`)
- **Purpose**: Clean and explore the dataset.
- **Details**:
  - Load and preprocess the dataset (`books_cleaned.csv`).
  - Generate a tagged description file (`tagged_description.txt`).
  - Analyze and identify inconsistencies in book categories.
  

### 2. Vector Search (`vector-search.ipynb`)
- **Purpose**: Build a semantic search engine for book descriptions.
- **Details**:
  - Use SBERT (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to encode book descriptions into embeddings.
  - Store and query embeddings using Chroma for fast similarity searches.
  

### 3. Text Classification (`text-classification.ipynb`)
- **Purpose**: Simplify and generalize book categories (`books_with_categories.csv`)
- **Details**:
  - Apply zero-shot classification using Hugging Face‚Äôs `bart-large-mnli` to map raw categories to broader ones.
  - Save the updated dataset with simplified categories.
  

### 4. Sentiment Analysis (`sentiment-analysis.ipynb`)
- **Purpose**: Add emotional tone analysis to book descriptions((`books_with_emotions.csv`).
- **Details**:
  - Use Hugging Face‚Äôs `DistilBERT` to analyze book descriptions for emotions like joy, sadness, and anger.
  - Append emotion scores to the dataset for personalized recommendations.
  

### 5. Gradio Dashboard (`app.py`)
- **Purpose**: Create an interactive user interface for book recommendations.
- **Details**:
  - Integrate semantic search, category filters, and tone analysis.
  - Display results with thumbnails, titles, and descriptions in a user-friendly format.
